## General features and changes:

 - Combine duplicated DMs
 - Re-try downloading resources upon failure

## Rage-inducing issues with provided data:

 - Posts with multiple slides are listed in JSON separate entries.
 - Posts have no indication of tagged users
 - DMs are split into separate conversations for no apparent reason; there is no way to determine continuity between entries if a member joins, leaves, or changes their name.
 - Images in DMs use URL signatures which expire after some unknown amount of time.
